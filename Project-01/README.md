In the state of Washington, we analyzed the number of electric vehicles by county population, top electric vehicles, eligibility status, & the trajectory of Base MSRP vs. electric range for both battery operated vehicles and plug in hybrids.  From this analysis, we provided visual insights utilizing bar graphs, pie graphs, and bubble graphs, along with both scatter plots & box plots. Lastly, we provided a statistical summary analysis of the data.  

# Question?

What is the relationship between County population and the number of electric vehicles in Washington?

What is the current relationship (number & percentage) between the county population and number of electric vehicles in Washington?

Provide general summary statitics on all electric vehicles in Washington.

Does electric range increase over time for newly manufactured electric vehicles?

Does mileage have any impact over the mileage range of electric vehicles?

Display electric vehicle clean alternative fuel eligibilty for the entire electric vehicle population.
